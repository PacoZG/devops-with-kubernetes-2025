# ðŸš€ Exercise 5.1. DIY CRD & Controller

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

We need a DummySite resource that can be used to create an HTML page from any
URL.

1. Create a "DummySite" resource that has a string property called "
   website_url".
2. Create a controller that receives a created "DummySite" object from the API
3. Have the controller create all of the resources that are required for the
   functionality.

The application can be found [here](./app)

After applying all the manifests we can access the page
in [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
