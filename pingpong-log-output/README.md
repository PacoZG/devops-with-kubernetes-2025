# üöÄ Exercise 4.7. Baby steps to GitOps

### Move the Log output application to use GitOps so that when you commit to the repository, the application is automatically updated.

## üèì 1. Ping-pong Application

## üöÄ Goal

Create a local deployment using Argo CD as a tool and synchronize the repository
automatically for any changes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

## ‚úÖ Deployment Summary

To achieve this, I avoided using
the [deployment script](deploy/scripts/deploy.sh) because Argo CD relies on
`kustomization.yaml` for application deployment. Running scripts through Argo CD
would require additional configurations and steps, which go against the
declarative GitOps workflow.

Nevertheless, the application was successfully deployed.
