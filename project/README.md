# Exercise 4.2. The project, step 21

#### Create the required probes and endpoint for The Project to ensure that it's working and connected to a database. Test that the probe indeed works with a version without database access, for example by supplying a wrong database URL or credentials.

- Read documentation for Kubernetes Engine Monitoring here(opens in a new tab)
  and setup logging for the project in GKE. You can optionally include
  Prometheus as well. Submit a picture of the logs when a new todo is created.

## âœ… Changes that needed to be done to the Project application

### 1. Change the code to create the endpoint to the server

```js
app.use('/healthz', async (_, res) => {
  try {
    const isDbConnected = await checkDbConnection()
    if (isDbConnected) {
      console.log(`Received a request to healthz and responding with status 200`)
      res.status(200).send('Application ready')
    } else {
      console.log(`Received a request to healthz and responding with status 500 - DB not connected`)
      res.status(500).send('Application not Ready - Database connection failed')
    }
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.error(`[ERROR] Healthz check failed:`, error.message)
    res.status(500).send(
      'Application not Ready - Internal server error during health check')
  }
})
```

where checkDbConnection function is:

```js
import { pool } from './initDb.js'

const checkDbConnection = async () => {
  try {
    // Perform a simple query to check the connection
    await pool.query('SELECT 1')
    return true
  }
  catch (error) {
    console.error('Database connection check failed:', error.message)
    return false
  }
}

export default checkDbConnection

```

### 2. I added readiness and liveness probes to the application server so that the

application will be only ready when the database is running

            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 3001
          livenessProbe:
            initialDelaySeconds: 20
            periodSeconds: 5
            httpGet:
              path: /healthz
              port: 3001
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: '64Mi'
              cpu: '250m'
            limits:
              memory: '516Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
```

and a backendConfig to allow the connections with the endpoint

```yaml
apiVersion: cloud.google.com/v1
kind: BackendConfig
metadata:
  name: server-http-hc-config
spec:
  healthCheck:
    checkIntervalSec: 15
    port: 3001
    type: HTTP
    requestPath: /healthz
```

I tested with the wrong path to the healthz probe and in fact the server would
never be deployed
